In 2005, the US National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) formed a consortium to sequence the B73 maize genome. 
The maize genome consists of ~85% of transposable elements. #MaizeEveryDay
In 2009 the B73 maize genome was around 2.5 million bases long with 32,540 genes. In comparison to the human genome with 2.9 million bases and 26,000 genes. #MaizeEveryDay

The Three Sisters are the three main agricultural crops of various indigenous groups in North America: winter squash, maize (corn), and climbing beans. #MaizeEveryDay
When planting the three sisters (maize, squash, beans) flat-topped mounds of soil are built for each cluster of crops.Each mound is about 30 cm (12 in) high and 50 cm (20 in) wide, and several maize seeds are planted close together in the center of each mound. #MaizeEveryDay
When planting the three sisters (maize, squash, beans) the maize provides a structure for the beans to climb, eliminating the need for poles. The beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use, and the squash spreads along the ground, blocking the sunlight, helping prevent the establishment of weeds. #MaizeEveryDay

Nixtamalization is a process for the preparation of maize (corn), or other grain, in which the corn is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution, usually limewater, washed, and then hulled. #MaizeEveryDay 
Nixtamalized maize has several benefits over unprocessed grain: It is more easily ground, its nutritional value is increased, flavor and aroma are improved, and mycotoxins are reduced. #MaizeEveryDay
